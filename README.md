# Project Moonbeam

We're a team of 50+ high schoolers around the world using mirrors put up by NASA's
Apollo 11 mission to encode data, send it to the moon as a laser, and decode it back.

We're just getting started and would love for you to be involved! Get in touch through
[our Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack) or [email](mailto:moonbeam-aaaaeyno5c2ppm6gn2xw3cq3ve@hackclub.slack.com).

An [open source project](https://github.com/hackclub/moonbeam) by [Hack Clubbers](https://hackclub.com).
